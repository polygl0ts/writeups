TUCTF 2018: Professor Plum's Ravenous Researcher
=============================

## Description

Professor Plum is hiring! Maybe you can get the job!

http://18.223.185.148/


## Solution

Professor Plum wants us to find Mr. Boddy. 

There is a page in which we can submit an input. (to find Boddy)
http://18.223.185.148/search.php

Giving random inputs, the site return: 
`Nice try but he's not there. Maybe try somewhere else in the mansion?`

We have a cookie with 2 fields: `Found_Boddy` and `Location`. In which Found_Boddy is set to 0.

Knowing that this challenge is a cluedo reference, the location of where Boddy is probably on of the 10 rooms of the game.

The rooms are: Kitchen, Ballroom, Conservatory, Dining Room, Cellar, Billiard Room, Library, Lounge, Hall, Study.

Then we tried all those room with the cookie parameter `Found_Boddy` set to 1.

Eventually we found Boddy in the Billiard Room!
