Hackover CTF 2018: military-crypto
==================================

## Description

We take security seriously so instead of shipping our own crypto we simply use
proven military grade technology for our firmware updates.

`nc military-crypto.ctf.hackover.de 1337`

## Solution

When connecting to the interface we're presented with a menu:

```
====================================================
    == secure update service

    we didn't roll our own, powered by the
    best crypto known to humanity
====================================================
1) Update firmware    3) Current firmware
2) Download firmware  4) Quit
```

* **Update firmware** asks us to upload a new firmware and a detached PGP
signature.

* **Download firmware** sends back the source code of the server encoded with
base64.

* **Current firmware** sends back a PGP signed message with some information
about the current firmware.

Clearly the goal here is to provide a new firmware and a signature to trick the
server into running it. So let's inspect the code of the server and see how the
verification is done.

```sh
update_firmware() {
   cat <<EOF
====================================================
    1) send update binary as base64
    2) finish with an empty line
    3) send detached signature as base64
    4) finish with an empty line
====================================================
EOF
   echo 'Reading firmware...'
   touch update.bin.b64
   while IFS='' read -r firmware; do
       if [ -z "$firmware" ]; then break; fi
       echo "$firmware" >> update.bin.b64
   done
   base64 -d update.bin.b64 > update.bin
   rm update.bin.b64

   echo 'Reading detatched signaure...'
   touch update.bin.sig
   while IFS='' read -r signature; do
       if [ -z "$signature" ]; then break; fi
       echo "$signature" >> update.bin.sig.b64
   done
   base64 -d update.bin.sig.b64 > update.bin.sig
   rm update.bin.sig.b64

   if ! gpg --verify update.bin.sig; then
       set +x
       echo '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
       echo '!! INVALID SIGNATURE !!'
       echo '!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
       exit 1
   else
       chmod +x update.bin
       echo 'Updating....'
       ./update.bin
       echo 'Rebooting....'
       exit 0
   fi
}
```

The firmware is verified with `gpg --verify update.bin.sig`. 

From `man gpg`:

```
--verify
              Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it
              without generating any output.

              ...

              gpg may assume that a single argument is a file with a detached
              signature, and it will try to find a matching data file by
              stripping certain suffixes. Using this historical feature to
              verify a detached signature is strongly discouraged; you should
              always specify the data file explicitly.
```

It seems that when `--verify` can both be used to verify signed files (where the
contents and the signature are in the same file) and files with a detached
signature (where the signature is in a separate file).

The server expects a detached signature for `update.bin` but if we instead send
a self-contained signed message, gpg will think that we're trying to verify the
contents of that file and ignore `update.bin`. The `Current firmware` command
conveniently sends back exactly that.

For the final exploit we can simply send a shell script that launches
`/bin/bash` as the new firmware and the output of `Current firmware` as the
signature.
